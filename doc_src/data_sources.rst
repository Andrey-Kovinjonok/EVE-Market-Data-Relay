Data Sources
============

EMDR is 'fed' data by player uploads. There are a number of clients that can
be used to chip in, outlined in more detail on :doc:`uploading`.

Uploader applications monitor the EVE Online cache files on your machine,
which are populated with market data as you browse around the in-game market
dialogs.

Individual market orders are uploaded, along with market history (if you
switch to history tabs for items).

Most well-designed uploader applications use small enough amounts of
CPU and bandwidth as to run unnoticed.
