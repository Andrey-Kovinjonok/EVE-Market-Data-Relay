Data Sources
============

EMDR is 'fed' by a number of market data sites, in addition to individual
player uploads. We're always looking to expand the feed to include more, so
please consider taking a look at :doc:`uploading` for details on how to
contribute data. There are instructions there for players and market data sites.

Current Sources
---------------

EMDR is currently relaying data from the following sources:

* `EVE Central`_ (orders only)
* `EVE Addicts`_ (all direct uploads)
* `EVE Marketdata`_ (orders+history via their recently updated API)
* Direct player uploads (see: :doc:`uploading`)

If we missed anything, or your site has started to feed data, please let us
know via an entry in our `issue tracker`_.

Coming Soon
-----------

We are aware of the following upcoming additions to our data feed:

* `EVE Marketeer`_ (all direct uploads, Callahan says sometime this weekend)
