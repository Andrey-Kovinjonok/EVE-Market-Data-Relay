Getting access to the EMDR network
==================================

In order to get access to the EMDR network, you will merely need to connect
to a relay. For your convenience, we have listed the relays below that have
available capacity.

* tcp://relay-linode-atl-1.eve-emdr.com:8050 (Linode, Atlanta -- Open)

Once you have chosen a relay, simply adapt the sample in
:doc:`using` to use the hostname/port of the relay of your choice.

.. note:: Some relays, marked as *Restricted*, require that you request
    access to use them. You will need to get in touch with the relay via the
    contact info listed to work it out with the admin.
