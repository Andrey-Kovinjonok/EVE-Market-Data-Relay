Getting access to the EMDR network
==================================

In order to get access to the EMDR network, you will merely need to connect
to a relay. For your convenience, we have listed the relays below that have
available capacity.

* These will be added once we go live.

Once you have chosen a relay, simply adapt the sample in
:doc:`using` to use the hostname/port of the relay of your choice.
