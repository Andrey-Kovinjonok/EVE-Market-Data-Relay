Getting access to the EMDR network

Once you have chosen a relay, simply adapt the sample in
:doc:`using` to use the hostname/port of the relay of your choice.

.. note:: Some relays, marked as *Restricted*, require that you request
    access to use them. You will need to get in touch with the relay via the
    contact info listed to work it out with the admin.
