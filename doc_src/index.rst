EVE Market Data Relay (EMDR)
============================

EVE Market Data Relay is  a super-scalable, super-available way to accept a large
amount of user-submitted market data (via uploaders), and re-broadcast said
data in near real-time to a large number of subscribers.

The end result is that those writing market-data driven applications could
simply subscribe to a "firehose" of market data, and get going, without having
to hassle with writing uploaders or data submission APIs. Users wouldn't need
to be asked to install yet another upload, or twiddle the settings on their
existing one. More about this can be seen in :doc:`overview`.
