Volunteering computing resources
================================

EMDR is ran by volunteers who foot the cost in order for everyone to get
access to market data. While running pieces of EMDR is not something that will
get you fame or notoriety, it is crucial to the continued survival and
success of the network.

If you have idle computing resources, or would like to share capacity on
a machine, we'd love to have it. ``gtaylor`` is available to assist with setup
and configuration.

Relays
------

Relays are our current need. These are at the lowest rung of the ladder, and
are where consumers connect to get their data. Relay access policy is completely
up to the volunteer. Relays can be 100% open to the public, or completely
restricted however you'd like.

Relay characteristics:

* Traffic depends entirely upon how many consumers are connected. However,
  most don't exceed 500 kb/s.
* Processor usage isn't huge. We've had great success running on Linodes and
  other virtual machines without issues.
* RAM usage is about 8-16 MB.

If you'd like to volunteer a relay, please get in touch with gtaylor via email:
