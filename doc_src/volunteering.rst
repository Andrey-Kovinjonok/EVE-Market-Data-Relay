Volunteering computing resources
================================

EMDR is ran by volunteers who foot the cost in order for everyone to get
access to market data. While running pieces of EMDR is not something that will
get you fame or notoriety, it is crucial to the continued survival and
success of the network.

If you have idle computing resources, or would like to share capacity on
a machine, we'd love to have it. ``gtaylor`` is available to assist with setup
and configuration.

Current status
--------------

We currently have everything that we need. Special thanks to everyone
who volunteered to help make this happen. Should our needs change, this page
will be updated, and announcement will land on the `mailing list`_.
