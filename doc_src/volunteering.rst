Volunteering computing resources
================================

This will contain details on how to volunteer your computing resources as we
see a need for them. We are going to need plenty of regional relays across
a number of the major hosting providers. In particular, we're interested in:

* Amazon Web Services
* Rackspace
* Linode

We will, of course, love to have anyone, but these three are likely to have
a good chunk of our consumers on them, which saves bandwidth for all of us.
