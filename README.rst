EVE Market Data Relay
=====================

:Author: Greg Taylor
:License: BSD

This project is a proof-of-concept for a super-scalable, affordable way to
accept a large amount of user-submitted market data (via uploaders), and
re-broadcast said data in realtime to a number of subscribers.

The end result is that those writing market-data driven applications could
simply subscribe to a "firehose" of market data, and get going, without having
to hassle with uploaders or data submission APIs.
